In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and behaviors that will characterize any object that is instantiated from the class. An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e., an object is created) memory is allocated. Attributes are properties of the class that are set to certain values for all objects of the class. You can access the attributes of a class using the dot notation. Classes can also have methods, which are functions associated with the class. Like attributes, methods can be accessed using the dot notation. The first parameter of any method is conventionally named `self`, which refers to the instance of the class.
